Paper Ideas

Paper ideas

1.	Using twitch.tv as an Online Education Platform - Online education is at its infancy. Videos don't really work, interaction  is minimal. twitch.tv is a platform used by millions of people. Can we leverage this platform for learning? My summer experiment of solving C++ questions live. Experiment failed, but the platform is attractive. [ Yusuf, Taylor, David, John, Victor ]

2.	Course Knowledge vs Technical Interviews - Traditional CS courses focus on concepts, data structures, building large software, but rarely on the type of "puzzles" that get asked as part of technical interviews. Can we integrate these puzzles into a regular classroom? What is the student perception of these difficult puzzles? How is this different than "problem solving" which is incorporated by all instructors? What are the obstacles for instructors? Can potentially run a survey of students in 343 and ask them their impressions. Can  give a "puzzle" to 343 students, a group that has been exposed to these puzzles and a group that have not and observe how they approach the problem, how they feel about the problem, etc. [ Yusuf, Isabel, Saml, Minh ]


3.	Students usage of drop-in centres. interview questions that come to QSC - how often they come, why they do or don't come? Interview QSC tutors on their impression of students, types of problems, how the process can be more streamlined. Interview students in a class, say 133, on why they do or don't use QSC, how they feel it differs from office hours. [ Yusuf, Isabel, Marcela (can generate a Google Form for QSC survey), Sam, Taylor ]


4.	Categorizing Programming puzzles - Look at a specific set of puzzles, say linked lists on leetcode and reflect on why it is difficult for students. You can reverse a singly linked list in O(n) with O(1) storage, but it is usually not the first approach that students will try. You can find out if a linked list is a palindrome in O(n) time and O(1) storage, but it requires some tricks. Students knows all the basics, but putting together parts of the puzzle might be difficult. Can we develop a set of exercises to help students [ Yusuf, Isabel, Victor, Minh ]


5.	Categorizing programming puzzles using Machine Learning - can we use the vocabulary used in a problem to come up with similar problems, to provide guidance and ideas to students [ Yusuf, Victor, Isabel, Minh ]


6.	Programming is easy clang-tidy is Hard. What does it take to produce high-quality code? What are students impressions, resistance, difficulties in using these industrial strength tools.  [ Yusuf ]


7.	Impact of Simple Quizzes with Infinite Repeats - 343-B had weekly simple quizzes. What are student impressions? How come all students are not getting 10/10 for all the quizzes since they can take it infinite number of times. When do students start quiz, how many times they do it, what resources get used for these quizzes? [ Yusuf, Sam ]


8.	Programs as Puzzles - The Memory-Leaks-R-Us assignment in 343 asks students to fix memory leaks. How do students approach this puzzle? Do all students complete? How to they use the tools available, IDE debugging? How does and how much their knowledge changes after this exercises? Is the exercise viewed as valuable or different than other types of assignments? [ Yusuf ]
